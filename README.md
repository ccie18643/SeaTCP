# SeaTCP

SeaTCP is an attempt to code the lightweight TCP/IP stack in C and Assembly languages. Its main goal is to achieve the lowest possible latency of packet processing. Implementation is based on experience gathered during the performance of the [PyTCP](https://github.com/ccie18643/PyTCP) project.
